*Add UserId to new topics & topic replies

*Change username to actual username instead of email

*Maybe add spinner to load more

*Posting a new topic two times in a row generates an Entity Db error

*Issue with topic replies (posts) and a foreign key constraint "FK_ForumPosts_ForumTopics_ForumTopicId"
