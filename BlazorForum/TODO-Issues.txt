### KNOWN ISSUES ###
* Issues with admin theme flipping back and forth when pages refresh. The admin index page (Dashboard) doesn't do it.


### TODO ###
* It would be nice if this could be updated with the click of a button at some point (when new app versions are released on GitHub)

* Maybe add spinner to load more, when loading more topics/posts

* Move strings to a resources file

* Admin - Membership sections are under development.

* dmin - Need to add Pages and Modules sections, or decide if they should be created.
