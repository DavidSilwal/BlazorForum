### KNOWN ISSUES ################################################

* The fields aren't validating properly (showing validation errors) when updating user info in the Membership area.

* Admin/Frontend themes still aren't flipping back and forth quite right when you navigate between them. If 
	you refresh it loads fine.

### TODO #########################################################

*** TESTS need written ***

* Admin - Membership sections are under development.

* Membership - Need to build in functionality to Remove role(s).

* Would be nice if a default user (Administrator) could somehow be installed when someone first builds/runs the 
	application? Or maybe the first registered user is automatically assigned to the Administrator role?

* Would like to be able to select a mode in the Admin area that determines if the front end forums will utilize support 
	forum type features (upvotes, codeblock editor, etc.) or a standard forum.

* Admin - Perhaps add ability to add Pages (ability to create pages to be used in the app) and Modules sections 
	(maybe some way to upload "plugin" type features), or decide if they should be created.

* Create a delete process for when a user delete's their profile to make sure it deletes all their posts, and any 
	child posts of topics they may have created.

* Move strings to a resources file

* Add spinner to load more, when loading more topics/posts

* It would be nice if this app could be updated with the click of a button at some point (when new app versions are 
	released on GitHub)
