### KNOWN ISSUES ###
* Posting a new topic or post two times in a row generates an Entity Db error. Is the dependency injection container not disposing context instances?

* Issues with admin theme flipping back and forth when pages refresh. The admin index page (Dashboard) doesn't do it.


### TODO ###
* It would be nice if this could be updated with the click of a button at some point (when new app versions are released)

* Change user usernames to actual username instead of email

* Maybe add spinner to load more, when loading more topics/posts

* Move strings to a resources file
