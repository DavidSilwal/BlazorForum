### KNOWN ISSUES ###
* Posting a new topic two times in a row generates an Entity Db error

* Unable to get username from their user id in a foreach loop without freezing (or infinite loop?)

* Issues with admin theme flipping back and forth when pages refresh. The admin index page (Dashboard) doesn't do it.


### TODO ###
* It would be nice if this could be updated with the click of a button

* Change user usernames to actual username instead of email

* Maybe add spinner to load more

* Move strings to resources file
